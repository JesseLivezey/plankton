Unequal height and width of images of the dataset give orientation information, it would good to use the image dimensions as an extra input or regressor for the network.

Plankton labels have two word names (e.g. siphonophore_physonect, siphonophore_pysonect_young), use this information as extra regressor so the network knows to group plankton to macro-labels (i.e siphonophore).

Use compression, original height/width, file date, etc as input features. Might also try as an output regressor, but we have these features on test data too so it makes more sense as an input.

put max_col_norm on Softmax layer, forces activations to drive output probabilities
